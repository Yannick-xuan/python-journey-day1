What's the difference between Miniconda and Anaconda?
Miniconda is a minimal installer that includes only conda, Python and essential 
packages. Anaconda is a full distribution that includes conda, Python, and over 150 
scientific packages. Miniconda is smaller and lets you install only what you need, while 
Anaconda provides a ready-to-use environment but takes more disk space.
